      "content": "<p>The beginning of a fabulous journey. Let's see where this takes us. I hope one day people look back at these texts among the other works I write as a classic, as the raw unfiltered version of my ideas. I hope the progression as I age is beautiful and easy to follow.</p><p>I sit here writing this listening to “Skyfall” by Adele. What a beautiful piece of music. I hope one day AI can experience music the way us humans can. The feeling it evokes, the magic it brings to our life, oh my. Words cannot describe it. The drama, the pure ethereal drama.</p><p>I am still unsure what I want to do with these ‘nonsensical musings,’ but I plan on writing my thoughts down as they come to me. Hopefully, I am as philosophical as my ego makes me out to be, or maybe I'm just some teenage loser who can’t decipher the difference between delusion and genius.</p><p>I guess today we will cover a part in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> that I read recently: “Of the Tree on the Mountainside.” (I really am writing this imagining a classroom studying my words—seriously, how egotistical is that?) Zarathustra speaks to a distraught young man about greatness.</p><p>No matter how you push on a tree there really is no point—it won’t budge. Still, somehow the invisible wind can make it sway. Similarly, a lot of your problems cannot be fixed physically, and as I take it, some things really are out of your control. Struggle must happen, and the wind will blow you. You cannot turn off the wind; you can only dig your roots deeper into the soil beneath you, to solidify your base.</p><p>Nietzsche talks about how to grow big and tall, a tree’s roots must also dig deeper into the ground, into the “evil.” I’ve also wondered in this metaphor: does this big tree take away underground “root space” for other trees? Is the path to ‘greatness,’ however you deem it, littered with the corpses of others? Have you taken away resources from others so that you can selfishly stand a bit taller? In the end, you are all trees anyway. No matter how big and tall you are, you will die, and honestly, you are just more appealing to lightning and lumberers.</p>"
