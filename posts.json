          "content": "The beginning of a fabulous journey. Let's see where this takes us. I hope one day people look back at these texts among the other works I write as a classic, as the raw unfiltered version of my ideas. I hope the progression as I age is beautiful and easy to follow.\n\nI sit here writing this listening to “Skyfall” by Adele. What a beautiful piece of music. I hope one day AI can experience music the way us humans can. The feeling it evokes, the magic it brings to our life, oh my. Words cannot describe it. The drama, the pure ethereal drama.\n\nI am still unsure what I want to do with these ‘nonsensical musings,’ but I plan on writing my thoughts down as they come to me. Hopefully, I am as philosophical as my ego makes me out to be, or maybe I'm just some teenage loser who can’t decipher the difference between delusion and genius.\n\nI guess today we will cover a part in *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* that I read recently: “Of the Tree on the Mountainside.” (I really am writing this imagining a classroom studying my words—seriously, how egotistical is that?) Zarathustra speaks to a distraught young man about greatness.\n\nNo matter how you push on a tree there really is no point—it won’t budge. Still, somehow the invisible wind can make it sway. Similarly, a lot of your problems cannot be fixed physically, and as I take it, some things really are out of your control. Struggle must happen, and the wind will blow you. You cannot turn off the wind; you can only dig your roots deeper into the soil beneath you, to solidify your base.\n\nNietzsche talks about how to grow big and tall, a tree’s roots must also dig deeper into the ground, into the “evil.” I’ve also wondered in this metaphor: does this big tree take away underground “root space” for other trees? Is the path to ‘greatness,’ however you deem it, littered with the corpses of others? Have you taken away resources from others so that you can selfishly stand a bit taller? In the end, you are all trees anyway. No matter how big and tall you are, you will die, and honestly, you are just more appealing to lightning and lumberers.\n\nThen also, as a big and tall tree, you look down on others. You can never see eye-to-eye. It is incredibly lonely. Such is the fate of great men. I really do feel like I’m stating the obvious—these seem to be conclusions drawn by everybody else, ever. What is my argument? Well, simply put, why be great? This is the path I’m headed down, or what I’m aspiring for, anyway. Greatness is another human construct, an imaginary value that people die for. I see two main reasons why people seek greatness—escape and glory. Escape, as once you are a big and tall tree, those lowly trees’ petty problems no longer affect you. But now instead of birds and squirrels, you face the threat of lightning. You cannot win. Glory—I still have to figure this out. Is it truly so great to be known? So that other trees can say to each other, “look at how big and tall X is”? So that two centuries later the average trees can group together and compare the heights of the tallest trees of all time, and imagine themselves in your roots?\n\nThe truth is—and I will come back to this frequently, I suspect—everything is really relative. My personal law of relativity. Good and bad generally equal out. Perhaps it's a matter of perspective too. The poorest man may not afford his son's education, but maybe he can enjoy peace. Jeff Bezos may have all the wealth in the world, but he will never have peace of mind (always a next thing). A child born with a lung condition, in pain and suffering every moment since birth, may have exclusive access to heaven. Being ‘average’ often brings community and comfort, but you will never be amazing. Perhaps regret is your burden. Being ‘extraordinary’ appeases the ego and fulfills your heart’s desire, but you will never enjoy the simple pleasures of the common man. Perhaps regret is your burden. Generally, things equal out. Of course, this is all conjecture and theory. Philosophy is pointless anyway; fundamental truth doesn't really exist unless you create it.\n\nSo why then, do anything? If A gives you a struggle of 50 and a happiness of 50, why move to B where both values may be 60? This is a question I ask myself often. I still have no answer. The human mind’s focus on the negative, despite the positives existing and balancing life out, pushes the person to grow. Grow towards what? I still do not know. If in general, struggle and happiness balance regardless of wealth, why climb the corporate ladder? Maybe I’ll understand, or find something wrong in my thinking. I often do.\n\nSolid start. The journey continues."
